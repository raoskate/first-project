            Operation Shattered Web features CS:GO’s
            first ‘agents,’ characters that can be equipped on the T or CT side.
            In addition to their unique look, Master Agents have special voice
            lines and animations–you’ll get one Master Agent when you earn your
            final reward.
            

            <p><h4>Missions Accomplished</h4></p>
            Each week, you’ll get access to new missions in various CS:GO game modes,
            including cooperative Guardian missions and an all-new Strike mission.
            Missions are available to all players, but you’ll need an Operation Pass to
            redeem your rewards.

            <p><h4>New Maps</h4></p>
            We’re also shipping a few new maps today in various game modes. 
            Defy gravity in the new Flying Scoutsman map Lunacy, and get ready to rumble 
            in the community-made Danger Zone map Jungle. Looking for something more 
            competitive? Try Studio, available as a Scrimmage or in the Casual Sigma map group!
